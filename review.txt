First, we would like to thank the reviewers for all feedback and fair
criticism, both from the technical and from the writing/presentation point of
view.

For each comment in the reviews, we modified the text accordingly and also
provide a detailed feedback below.

We also identified three main areas that demanded a major review, since they
appeared in comments from all reviewers with variations.

1. Make the paper scope/contributions/limitations more clear/explicit.
   We needed to rewrite parts of the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion.
   Follows the reviewer comments related to this area:
    - "abstract is very lightweight", "does not address the novelty", "is
      lacking a full rounded overview of the paper by not including some of the
      findings"
    - "the conclusion does not talk to the protocol’s novelty or innovation,
      nor does it provide context in terms of implications or real world
      applications"
    - "the rest of the introduction, however, delves too much into the
       mechanisms of the system"
    - "the introduction should be restructured to simply state what the
       proposed model is all about, what the main contributions are, why this
       is different from other existing models and why this is novel"
    - "the novelty does not come across strongly currently", "the author needs
      to start the paper strong to really pull the reader in and convince about
      the novelty of the proposed model"
    - "the author should clearly identify the novelty and the motivation of his
      work in the introduction comparing it to existing work"

   We also respond individually to each of these comments below.

2. Improve related work.
   We...
   Follows the reviewer comments related to this area:
    - "section 5 only provides a very basic related work section", "needs to be
      further developed to truly show how this system differs from and approves
      upon currently available technologies", "particularly section 5.1 just
      scratches the surface and needs to be extended"
    - "the reference list is overall a bit unbalanced, with not enough recent
      academic citations"
    - Does the manuscript contain sufficient and appropriate references?
      2/3 reviewers chose option "Important references are missing; more
      references are needed"
      1/3 chose option "References are sufficient and appropriate"

3. Show more discussion/evidence/evaluation about the protocol.
   We...
   Follows the reviewer comments related to this area:
    - "this paper lacks analysis or experiments to prove the correctness of the
      design"
    - "does the prototype system have sufficient performance to support real
      Internet forums?"
    - "what is the complexity of the proposed algorithm?"
    - "the discussion part needs to be expanded", "the author must discuss the
      efficiency of the proposed approach to deal with different attacks",
      "mention the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed protocol",
      "the attacks that the algorithm can detect and those that cannot detect"
    - "an experimental or simulation results with comparison to existing works
      is missing in this paper"
    - Is the manuscript technically sound?
      2/3 reviewers chose option "Appears to be - but didn't check completely"
      1/3 chose option "Yes"

Next, we go through each comment individually and respond to each of them.

# Reviewer 1

## Comments:

> 1. Keywords should include blockchain.

OK.

> 2. In the abstract and introduction, it is emphasized many times that the
>    protocol proposed in this paper is a publish-subscribe protocol.
>    However, the following design does not reflect the characteristics of the
>    publish-subscribe system.

- TODO
- explicar topic-based pub-sub
- tentar fazer mais mencoes ao pub-sub
- como aparece na pratica no protocolo

In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where
senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent
directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize
published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any,
there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes
and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which
publishers, if any, there are.

> 3. Authors should use pseudo-code or flowcharts to describe the system
     design. The use of commands can be designated as supplemental material.

We opted for one-line commands because they are real and provide a concrete
perception of the protocol.
We believe that using pseudo-code would not simplify the presentation while
adding a distracting extra abstraction.

> 4. Authors should illustrate the contents in Figure 1, Figure 3, and Figure 6
     by tables.

We renamed them all as tables.

> 5. This paper lacks analysis or experiments to prove the correctness of the
     design. For example, is it possible for attackers to manipulate the block
     order in the ordering algorithm shown in Figure 4.A? Does the prototype
     system have sufficient performance to support real Internet forums?

DIFICIL

> 6. The organization of the paper can be improved.

# Reviewer 1

## Comments:

> 1. The abstract is very lightweight, presenting only a very brief description
     of what the paper will be addressing. It does not clearly explain the
     application of Bitcoin, and does not address the novelty.
     The abstract is lacking a full rounded  overview of the paper by not
     including some of the findings.

TODO

> 2. Similarly, the conclusion does not talk to the protocol’s novelty or
     innovation, nor does it provide context in terms of implications or real
     world applications.

TODO

> 3. The introduction’s second paragraph provides a good insight into the
     problem that is being addressed. The rest of the introduction, however,
     delves too much into the mechanisms of the system. The introduction should
     be restructured to simply state what the proposed model is all about, what
     the main contributions are, why this is different from other existing
     models and why this is novel. The novelty does not come across strongly
     currently. The author needs to start the paper strong to really pull the
     reader in and convince about the novelty of the proposed model.

TODO

## Some specific comments:

> Page 1: “Content publishing in public Internet forums and social media
>         platforms is increasingly more centralized in a few companies.”
>         Which companies? Adding an example here would make it easier for the
>         reader to connect with the paper.

>         updated. Same with Figure 6.

We renamed them all as tables (also Figure 3).

> - Section 2 provides a functional description of Freechains and some metadata
>   at the end of the section. By moving this metadata to the beginning of the

TODO

TODO

> - Figure 2(C), it is not clear how the ‘likes’ are stored. The figure
>   indicates two arrows, but how is this recorded and stored in the chain?

- colocar block as JSON?

TODO

>   reader friendly and make the examples in the text more self-explanatory.

TODO

> - Section 3.1: “If a branch creates enough reps to reach 50% of its prefix”.
>   50% of what? This sentence needs a bit more context. “If a branch creates
>   enough reps to reach 50% of its prefix, then the algorithm orders this

>   prefix accumulates 50 reps considering users a, b, and c. If branch-1
>   creates at least 25 new reps, then the merge with branch-2 will fail and
>   the chains will never synchronize again.” This seems contradictory. If a
>   branch reaches 50% reps of the prefix, then it will be ordered first. That

>   then branch 2. However, in the narrative quoted above, it states the

>   and separately, prefix and then branch 2. This is not the same scenario.

TODO
- algo has changed, now by time

> - Section 3.2: More details about the pioneers needed. How many pioneers?
    From the discussion it seems that there would be multiple pioneers, but
    then the last sentence of paragraph 2 refers to ‘single pioneer’. This is
    not well written and causing some confusion.

TODO

> - Figure 6 refers to a discount period. This is not clearly explained in the
>   text. The time aspect is also a bit ambiguous. During a 24 hour period, a
>   poster can only get rewarded with 1 rep, although they can post multiple
>   times during that 24 hour period, as long as they have reps available. Is
>   that one rep reward additional to the initial 30 available reps? If not,
>   how would this encourage discussion? If this is addressed in the paper, it
>   did not come across well and needs a bit further refinement to remove
>   ambiguity.

TODO

TODO
